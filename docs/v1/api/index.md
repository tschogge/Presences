# API Reference

This section provides detailed documentation for the PreMiD Activity Development API. It covers all the classes, interfaces, and functions available for creating activities.

## Overview

The PreMiD API consists of several key components:

- [Presence Class](/v1/api/presence-class): The main class for creating activities
- [PresenceData Interface](/v1/api/presence-data): The interface for defining what data to show in Discord
- [Metadata Interface](/v1/api/metadata-json): The interface for defining activity metadata
- [Slideshow Class](/v1/api/slideshow): A class for creating slideshows that alternate between different presence data
- [iFrame Class](/v1/api/iframe): A class for interacting with iframes
- [Utility Functions](/v1/api/utility-functions): Helper functions for common tasks

## Getting Started

If you're new to PreMiD Activity Development, we recommend starting with the [Guide](/v1/guide/) section, which provides step-by-step instructions for creating your first activity.

## Type Definitions

The API is fully typed with TypeScript, and the type definitions are available in the `@types/premid` package. You can find the source code for the type definitions in the [Activities repository](https://github.com/PreMiD/Activities/tree/main/%40types/premid).

## Examples

For practical examples of how to use the API, check out the [Examples](/v1/examples/) section, which provides sample code for various types of activities.
