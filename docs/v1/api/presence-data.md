# PresenceData Interface

The `PresenceData` interface defines the structure of the data that is sent to Discord to display in the user's status. It allows you to customize what information is shown in the Discord Activity.

## Structure

The `PresenceData` interface is a union of two interfaces:

- `MediaPresenceData`: For activities related to media (watching or listening)
- `NonMediaPresenceData`: For other types of activities

Both extend the `BasePresenceData` interface, which contains the common properties.

## Properties

## ButtonData Interface

The `ButtonData` interface defines the structure of buttons that can be added to the presence.

| Property | Type                                  | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `label`  | `string \| Node \| null`              | Text for the button |
| `url`    | `string \| HTMLAnchorElement \| null` | URL of button link  |

## ActivityType Enum

The `ActivityType` enum defines the types of activities that can be displayed.

| Value       | Description                    | Example                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `Playing`   | Shows as "Playing [name]"      | "Playing Minecraft"         |
| `Listening` | Shows as "Listening to [name]" | "Listening to Spotify"      |
| `Watching`  | Shows as "Watching [name]"     | "Watching YouTube"          |
| `Competing` | Shows as "Competing in [name]" | "Competing in a tournament" |

## StatusDisplayType Enum

The `StatusDisplayType` enum controls which field is displayed in the user's status text in the member list.

| Value     | Description               | Example                |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Name`    | Display the activity name | "Playing [name]"       |
| `State`   | Display the state field   | "Listening to [state]" |
| `Details` | Display the details field | "Watching [details]"   |

## Examples

### Basic Presence

```typescript
const presenceData: PresenceData = {
  details: 'Browsing the homepage',
  state: 'Reading articles',
  largeImageKey: ActivityAssets.Logo,
  startTimestamp: browsingTimestamp
}
```

### Media Presence (Watching)

```typescript
const presenceData: PresenceData = {
  type: ActivityType.Watching,
  details: 'Watching a video',
  state: 'Video Title',
  largeImageKey: ActivityAssets.Logo,
  largeImageText: 'Website Name',
};

[presenceData.startTimestamp, presenceData.endTimestamp] = getTimestampsFromMedia(document.querySelector('video'))
```

#### Special Season and Episode Formatting

When using `ActivityType.Watching`, Discord provides special formatting for TV shows with seasons and episodes. If you set the `largeImageText` property to follow the pattern "word digit, digit", Discord will automatically display a special season and episode indicator in "S1E2" format.

For example:

```typescript
// This will display a special season and episode indicator in Discord
presenceData.type = ActivityType.Watching
presenceData.largeImageText = 'Season 2, Episode 5'
```

The important part is the pattern: any word, followed by a space, followed by a digit, followed by a comma and space, followed by another digit. While you can use "Season 2, Episode 5" as shown above, the actual word doesn't matter - Discord automatically detects this pattern and converts it to "S2E5" format in the display.

This special formatting only works when the activity type is set to `ActivityType.Watching`.

Here's how it looks in Discord:

![Season and Episode Indicator in Discord](https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Season+and+Episode+Indicator+Example)

_Note: This image shows how Discord displays the special season and episode indicator (S1E2) when using the correct formatting pattern._

### Presence with Buttons

```typescript
const presenceData: PresenceData = {
  details: 'Reading an article',
  state: 'Article Title',
  largeImageKey: ActivityAssets.Logo,
  buttons: [
    {
      label: 'Read Article',
      url: 'https://example.com/article'
    },
    {
      label: 'Visit Website',
      url: 'https://example.com'
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- The `details` and `state` fields have a maximum length of 128 characters.
- Button labels have a maximum length of 32 characters.
- Button URLs must be valid HTTPS URLs.
- You can have a maximum of 2 buttons.
- The `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp` can be provided as either a Unix timestamp in milliseconds or a Date object.
- If both `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp` are provided, only the `endTimestamp` will be used to show "remaining" time.
